Introducing VOD clipping! Now you can create up-to 45 second long clips and share with your friends and with the internet at large.
The 45 second limitiations is somewhat arbitrary so if you'd like to create longer clips, reach out and let us know about your use case so we can learn more about your use case.
In the short term, we're going to be focusing on the user experience from when you just sign up to when you've recorded your 100th video so let us know how we can make your time with SquadOV better!
