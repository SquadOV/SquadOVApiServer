Oh my goodness, it's been a crazy day and there's about 250 more of you here now.
We're still aware of a bunch of issues and we're working on them but we wanted to get these out of the way first.

## Bug Fixes
* Fixed an issue where you had to login to the web app for email verification (our bad).
* Added support for the Windows Graphics Capture framework. Previously SquadOV would capture windowed mode WoW as a fully white screen, that's now fixed.
* Fixed alt-tabbing for windowed fullscreen apps so that we don't accidentally pick up other apps instead.
