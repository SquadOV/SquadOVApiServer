This patch is a bit earlier than our typical patch time to prep for our Valorant release.
But it also contains an often-asked-for feature: local recording!
There are some limitations to local recording though.
Notably, you will not be able to see locally recorded matches in the "Recent VODs" newsfeed; however, you are able to view all your matches as per usual in the game logs.
Note that you should consider this an "alpha" release of local recording, so expect some bugs as we get the kinks worked out.

## Features
* Ability to record to your computer locally and manually specify which VODs are uploaded to SquadOV later.

## Improvements
* Support for OpenGraph and Twitter Cards for our share links.
* Enabled the variable framerate option by default for everybody.

## Bug Fixes
* Additional fixes to hopefully fix Hearthstone crash.
* Fix to show death recap and player info on shared WoW match pages.
* Hopefully fix an issue that was causing some of our VOD processing instances to get stuck processing some VODs.
