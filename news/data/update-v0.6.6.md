Quick update! Nothing super fancy to see here. :)

## Features
* Welcome Emails. Every user who has not yet received a welcome email will receive an automated welcome email the next time they login.
* Default Squads. Every user, when they first register, will now have a default squad that includes Derek and Mike.

## Improvements
* Slight performance improvement for when we're recording in fullscreen using the DXGI desktop duplication API.
* Better error messages on the registration screen for using a taken username/email.
* Squad invites by username are no longer case sensitive.

## Bug Fixes
* Fixed an issue with a gigantic (infinite) memory spike when recording in windowed mode in games not named WoW.
