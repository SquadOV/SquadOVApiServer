Hello everybody from /r/valorant!
It was a bit rough with everybody joining all at once, but we should be significantly more stable now after a couple of server patches to get the queues going.
If you still don't see your Riot account linked, please try again, and if that doesn't work, submit a bug report!

## Features
* You can now actually change the local storage location.

## Improvements
* We now prioritize WGC over GDI for capturing windows, this means you'll see a yellow border around windows.
* Clarified wording about what enable local storage actually does.
* The recent matches/VODs page should now load significantly quicker.

## Bug Fixes
* Finally fixed issue where Hearthstone matches would not record.
* Fixed various crashes that could occur when recording in fullscreen mode.
* Fixed issue where video and audio could become de-synced when using variable framerate.
* Fixed issue where clip library was returning clips out of order.
* Fixed an issue (possibly) where VOD processing was getting stuck.
* Fixed an issue (possibly) where Riot account linking was getting stuck.
