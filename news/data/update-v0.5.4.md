Welcome to the v0.5.4 update! At this point we've finished implementing support for our initial set of games (we're just waiting for an API key from Riot Games to officially release League of Legends and Teamfight Tactics) so we're going to be focusing more on how we can best help you share your best gaming moments with your friends.
To that end, this update is focused on transforming the dashboard into an area where you're able to interact with your friends whether it's by checking their current online status, watching their recent VODs, or inviting new friends to SquadOV!

### Features
* Invite friends to your squads by username OR email! We'll send an email to invite them to register for SquadOV if they haven't done so already!
* View the current status (online/offline/in-game/recording) of your squadmates straight from the dashboard.
* View your recent recorded playtime across our supported games on the dashboard.
* Display recent games recorded by you and your squadmates on your dashboard along with a nifty video thumbnail (video thumbnails will only be generated for new recorded VODs)!
* A status indicator that'll display if we're encountering any service disruptions. Check our [status page](https://squadov.statuspage.io/) for additional information.
* The recent news widget will show all patch updates and any important information we might have for you!

### Known Issues
* We're aware of an issue where SquadOV may fail to update properly. We're looking into it.
