## Features
* Ability to manually delete and re-sync Riot accounts. Riot accounts will automatically be re-synced (game name and tagline) upon launching VALORANT.

## Bug Fixes
* Fixed a crash in the new audio encoding engine that would cause some games to not record.
* Fixed an issue where we would not be handling DPI scaling properly.
* Fixed an issue where viewing a WoW arena match would display victory/loss (and friendly team information) incorrectly.
* Disable allowing the video player to jump to events until the video is playable.
* Fixed the World of Warcraft event filter to accurately filter out enemy pets in arena matches.

## Other
* We're attempting to narrow down on an issue where SquadOV will sometimes detect the game as not being fullscreen when the game is in fullscreen windowed mode.
