WoW classic has arrived!
Consider it to be an early alpha where things may still be broken, but check it out and let us know how it goes!

## Features
* WoW classic support: TBC and Vanilla.

## Improvements
* Better internalization for date/time formats.
* Removed the username under the squad name.
* Viewing a private profile in a web browser not has a message that tells you that information.
* The "X days ago" label now uses calendar days instead of assuming that 1 day = 24 hours.
* All game log filters now only show matches with VODs by default to avoid confusion.
* Flipped Valorant weapon images to make guns point in direction of victim.

## Bug Fixes
* Fixed typo where KDA was being written as (Kills + Deaths) / Assists.
* Fixed an issue where old video URLs were being used causing issues where the media/source could not be played.
* Fixed an issue where the recent VODs game filter was not shown.
* Fixed an issue where we would not display CSGO VODs properly if you've played on multiple accounts.
* Fixed an issue where profile display names would not update.
* Fixed an issue with bug reports that would not submit if there was a % sign.
